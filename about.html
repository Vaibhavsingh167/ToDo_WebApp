        <p style="line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.2rem;">
            Welcome to my ToDo website! This platform allows you to efficiently manage your tasks 
            by providing functionalities to add, update, and delete tasks seamlessly. 
            It is built using <strong>Flask</strong> as the backend framework, which handles 
            all database operations and serves the web pages dynamically. 

            <br><br>

            The frontend is crafted with <strong>Bootstrap</strong> to ensure a clean, 
            responsive, and user-friendly interface. Bootstrapâ€™s components help in designing 
            a visually appealing layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

            <br><br>

            <strong style="font-size: 1.5rem;">How It Works:</strong>
            <ul style="text-align: left; margin-left: 20px; font-size: 1.3rem;">
                <li><strong>Create Tasks:</strong> Users can create new tasks by entering a title and a description, 
                followed by clicking the submit button. This adds the task to the list of ToDos.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Update Tasks:</strong> Users can modify existing tasks by clicking the "Update" button 
                next to the respective task, allowing changes to the title and description.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Delete Tasks:</strong> To remove tasks, users can click the "Delete" button. 
                This helps maintain an organized task list, ensuring that only relevant tasks are kept.</li>
            </ul>

            <br><br>

            This project showcases the synergy between Flask for backend functionality and Bootstrap for frontend styling, 
            resulting in an effective and enjoyable user experience. I hope you find it helpful in managing your tasks!
